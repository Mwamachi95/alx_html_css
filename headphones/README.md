# Web Page Implementation Project

## Overview

In this project, I implemented a web page from scratch **without using any library**. This project is a test of my understanding and skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Accessibility**, and **Responsive Design**.

## Objective

The goal is simple: **Create a fully functional web page that matches the provided designer file**. I had the freedom to choose how I implement it, as long as the final result meets the design requirements.

## Requirements

- **HTML:** I structured the content semantically and follow best practices.
- **CSS:** I styled the page to match the design file exactly.
- **Accessibility:** I ensured the page is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
- **Responsive Design:** The web page works seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.

## My Approach

1. I did **not** use any CSS frameworks, libraries, or pre-built components.
2. I leveraged my knowledge of:
   - Semantic HTML
   - Custom CSS for styling
   - Accessibility principles
   - Media queries and responsive design techniques
3. The implementation was up to me; I got creative while ensuring the page functions and appears as expected.
